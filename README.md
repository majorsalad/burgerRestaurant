# Burger Restuarant
A Java program utilizing all of the foundational OOP concepts to simulate a burger-restaurant

# Instructions:
> All of the classes are found within Main.java
> Run the .java file

# What I learned:
> I learned about encapsulating your data and classes to prevent unwanted access
> I learned about composition and the "has-a" relationship that is sometimes necessary between classes.
> Inheritance and the various uses of the "is-a" relationship between parent and child classes
> Polymorphism and the different possible actions that one can take advantage of using classes that override methods
